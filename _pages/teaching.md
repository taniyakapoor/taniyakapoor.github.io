As an active contributor to the intersection of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) and beam dynamics, I have had the privilege of guiding and supervising a range of projects within this innovative domain. My involvement has been multifaceted, ranging from direct project supervision to the leadership in thesis proposals. Here's a closer look at my supervisory roles:

**Direct Supervision**

Currently, I am supervising two master's students on a project that aims at the generalization of neural PDE solvers. This work aims to tackle a challenge of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is its generalization beyond the training domain, especially when dealing with complex physical problems represented by partial differential equations (PDEs). 

**Leading a Master Thesis Proposal**

I have successfully led a master thesis proposal that explores the use of PIML in beam dynamics. This initiative marks a significant step forward in research, opening new pathways for future explorations in the field.

**Co-Supervision of a Master's Thesis**

It has been an honor to co-supervise a master's student whose thesis project delves into the intricacies of beam dynamics through the lens of PIML. This collaboration has been instrumental in enriching the student's academic and research experience.

**Course Development**

I played a pivotal role in the project development of a master's course "Data Science and AI for Engineers," specifically designed to integrate PIML for beam dynamics. This project is tailored to arm students with the essential machine learning techniques needed for understanding and simulating beam dynamics effectively using PIML.

**Supervision Component**

A key feature of this course is my dedicated three-month supervisory support for a group of nine students. This period is not merely academic but a deep dive into the practical application of PIML in real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing the learning experience.

**Educational Material Preparation**

In addition to my supervisory roles, I have been committed to creating and developing educational materials to further support learning in both bachelor's and master's levels. These materials are designed to offer comprehensive insights into machine learning, tailored specifically for courses such as:

A1;
MUDE;
Dynamica;
IFEEMCS520100.
