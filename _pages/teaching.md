Master's Course Development and Supervision

I played a pivotal role in formulating a proposal for a master's course uniquely designed to integrate PIML within the context of beam dynamics. This initiative aimed at equipping students with the necessary skills to apply machine learning techniques in physics, particularly in understanding and manipulating the dynamics of particle beams.

Supervisory Support: Central to this course was my commitment to providing three months of supervisory support to a group of nine dedicated students. This project was not just an educational journey but a pioneering exploration into applying PIML in practical, real-world scenarios within beam dynamics.

Educational Material Preparation

My efforts extended to the development of comprehensive tutorial on machine learning and examination materials tailored for bachelor's and master's courses, including:

A1
MUDE
Dynamica
IFEEMCS520100

Supervision Achievements

I have been deeply involved in supervising on various projects at the forefront of PIML. My supervision activities include:

Leading a Master Thesis Proposal: I spearheaded a master thesis proposal focusing on the application of PIML in beam dynamics, setting a new direction for future research in the field.
Co-Supervision of a Master's Thesis: I had the privilege of co-supervising a master's student whose thesis project centered on beam dynamics using PIML, contributing to their academic and professional development.
Direct Supervision of Student Projects: I am currently supervising two master's students on a project aimed at extrapolating PIML for PDE solver.
