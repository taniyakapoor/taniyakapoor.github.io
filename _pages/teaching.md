**Supervision**

I am currently working with three PhD researchers to develop a generalizable AI tool for engineering systems. I believe AI has much potential to offer and will be embedded throughout our world in the same way computers do today.

I supervised two master's students on a project that aims at the generalization of neural PDE solvers. This work aims to tackle the challenge of PIML in its generalization beyond the training domain, especially when dealing with complex physical problems represented by partial differential equations. I am happy to share our collaborative work, "Neural Differential Equation-Based Two-Stage Approach for Generalization of Beam Dynamics," published at IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics :)

**Leading a Master Thesis Proposal**

I have successfully led a master thesis proposal that explores the use of PIML in beam dynamics. 

**Co-Supervision of a Master's Thesis**

I am co-supervising a master's student whose thesis project delves into the intricacies of beam dynamics through the lens of PIML.

**Course Development**

I played a pivotal role in the project development of a master's course "Data Science and AI for Engineers". This project is tailored to arm students with the essential machine learning techniques needed for understanding and simulating beam dynamics using PIML.

**Supervision Component**

In this project, my role is for three-month supervisory support for a group of nine students. 

**Educational Material Preparation**

In addition to my supervisory roles, I have been involved to create and develop educational materials to further support learning in both bachelor's and master's levels. These materials are designed to offer comprehensive insights into machine learning, tailored specifically for courses such as:

A1;
MUDE;
Dynamica;
Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence Programme.
