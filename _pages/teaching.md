At Wageningen University & Research (WUR), I am currently involved in research supervision and course development in the areas of artificial intelligence, deep learning, and data science. I co-supervise two PhD candidates and one postdoctoral researcher and contribute to the development of teaching materials. I will serve as a lecturer for the courses Deep Learning and Data Science for Global Challenges 2 and have previously been an invited speaker for AI for Science and Engineering.

Previously at TU Delft, my teaching and supervision activities focused on the integration of AI into engineering education, particularly through physics-informed machine learning (PIML). I supervised and co-supervised several master’s thesis projects on neural PDE solvers and beam dynamics, contributing to peer-reviewed research published in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics. I also collaborated with PhD researchers on the development of generalizable AI tools for engineering systems, supported project-based learning in the master’s course Data Science and AI for Engineers, and developed educational materials for bachelor’s and master’s courses including A1, MUDE, Dynamica, and the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence programme.
