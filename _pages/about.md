I am an Assistant Professor in the Artificial Intelligence Group at Wageningen University & Research (WUR). My research interests lie broadly in Machine Learning for the Sciences and Science for Machine Learning. In particular, I focus on developing ML models that integrate physical knowledge such as partial differential equations, ordinary differential equations, and physical laws, to tackle global challenges.

I obtained my PhD at TU Delft, where I worked on physics-informed machine learning for structural engineering applications under the supervision of Dr. Hongrui Wang, Dr. Alfredo Núñez, and Prof. Rolf Dollevoet. Following the completion of my PhD, I was awarded the AI Schmidt Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Oxford to develop engineering-informed foundation models for sustainable structural design. Prior to that, I worked at ETH Zürich (CAMLab) on physics-informed neural networks for nonlinear PDEs, and I completed my master’s studies in Applied Mathematics and High-Performance Scientific Computing at South Asian University (India) and Université de Lille (France).
