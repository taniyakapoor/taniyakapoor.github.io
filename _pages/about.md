I am an Assistant Professor in the [**Artificial Intelligence Group at WUR**](https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/taniya-kapoor.htm). My research centers on machine learning for the sciences and science for machine learning. Briefly, I develop machine learning models that integrate physical knowledge in the form of differential equations and fundamental physical laws to tackle global scientific challenges.

Before that, I was awarded the Schmidt Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Oxford, focusing on engineering-informed foundation models for sustainable structural design. Earlier, I did my PhD at [**TU Delft**](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures) with Dr. Hongrui Wang, Dr. Alfredo Núñez, and Prof. Rolf Dollevoet, followed by a postdoctoral position at TU Delft on generalization issues in physics-informed machine learning. Previously, during my master, I spent eight months at [**ETH Zürich (CAMLab)**](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html) working with Prof. Siddhartha Mishra on physics-informed neural networks for fully nonlinear partial differential equations. 

My work has been recognized as a Top Reviewer Award at NeurIPS 2025. I have also been a visiting research fellow at the [**University of Oxford**](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) and [**the Vector Institute for AI**](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/rahul-g-krishnan/) .

My current research revolves around physics-informed learning, scientific foundation models, and their applications across science and engineering.
