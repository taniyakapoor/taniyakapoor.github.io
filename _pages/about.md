I am a PhD researcher in the Engineering Structures [Department](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures/sections-labs/railway-engineering/staff), Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at TU Delft. My research interests focus on the fusion of scientific machine learning and structural engineering. 

Prior to this, I worked as an intern at [CAMLab](https://camlab.ethz.ch), a seminar for applied mathematics at ETH Zurich, in the domain of physics-informed neural networks for fully non-linear PDEs. I received my masterâ€™s degree in applied mathematics and scientific computing from [South Asian University](https://sau.int), India and [University de Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr), France.

Here is a recent copy of my  [CV](https://taniyakapoor.github.io/files/Taniya_CV-5.pdf).
