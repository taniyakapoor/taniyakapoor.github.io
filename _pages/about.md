I am an Assistant Professor in the [**Artificial Intelligence Group at WUR**](https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/taniya-kapoor.htm). My work focuses on solving physical equations (in the form of PDEs, ODEs) that model real-world phenomena using machine learning. I believe we need to leverage the physical knowledge that we have over the years to reduce data dependency.   

Before this, I was awarded the [**AI Schmidt Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Oxford**](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-05-02-oxford-welcomes-new-schmidt-ai-science-fellows), focusing on engineering-informed foundation models for sustainable structural design. Earlier, I did my PhD and Postdoc at [**TU Delft**](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures) with Dr. Hongrui Wang, Dr. Alfredo Núñez, and Prof. Rolf Dollevoet, focusing on the generalization issues in physics-informed machine learning. 

Furthermore, I was awarded the CEMPI Labex Fellowship to pursue my master’s degree in high performance scientific computing at the [**Université de Lille**](https://hpc.univ-lille.fr/en/), France. During my master’s internship, I spent eight months at [**ETH Zürich (CAMLab)**](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html) working with Prof. Siddhartha Mishra on physics-informed neural networks for fully nonlinear partial differential equations.
