I am an Assistant Professor in the [**Artificial Intelligence Group at WUR**](https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/taniya-kapoor.htm). My research develops machine learning to advance scientific discovery, and employs scientific principles to enhance machine learning itself. I build models that blend data-driven methods with established physical laws, such as differential equations, to address major global challenges. 

Before this, I was awarded the [**AI Schmidt Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Oxford**](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-05-02-oxford-welcomes-new-schmidt-ai-science-fellows), focusing on engineering-informed foundation models for sustainable structural design. Earlier, I did my PhD and Postdoc at [**TU Delft**](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures) with Dr. Hongrui Wang, Dr. Alfredo Núñez, and Prof. Rolf Dollevoet, focusing on the generalization issues in physics-informed machine learning. 

Previously, during my masters, I spent eight months at [**ETH Zürich (CAMLab)**](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html) working with Prof. Siddhartha Mishra on physics-informed neural networks for fully nonlinear partial differential equations. I have also been a visiting research fellow at the [**University of Oxford**](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) and the [**Vector Institute for AI**](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/rahul-g-krishnan/). My work has been recognized with a [**Top Reviewer Award at NeurIPS 2025**](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/ProgramCommittee). 

Currently, I am developing physics-informed machine learning techniques and scientific foundation models with applications across a wide range of science and engineering fields.
