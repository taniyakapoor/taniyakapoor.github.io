I’m delighted to share that I will be joining the University of Oxford as an [AI Schmidt Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/research-funding/internal-research-funding/the-eric-and-wendy-schmidt-ai-in-science-postdoctoral-fellowship-program).

I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the Engineering Structures [Department](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures/sections-labs/railway-engineering/staff), Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at TU Delft. My research interests focus on the fusion of scientific machine learning and structural engineering. 

I received my PhD degree in Physics-informed machine learning for beam structures applications, from the Engineering Structures Department at TU Delft. Before this, I worked as an intern at [CAMLab](https://camlab.ethz.ch), a seminar for applied mathematics at ETH Zurich, in physics-informed neural networks for fully non-linear PDEs. I received my master’s degree in applied mathematics and scientific computing from [South Asian University](https://sau.int), India, and [University de Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr), France.

Here is a recent copy of my  [CV](https://taniyakapoor.github.io/files/Taniya_CV_new.pdf).
