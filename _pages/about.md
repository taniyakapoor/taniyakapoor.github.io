### News

I’m delighted to share that I will be joining the University of Oxford as an **AI Schmidt Postdoctoral Fellow**.

---

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Engineering Structures Department](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures/sections-labs/railway-engineering/staff), Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at TU Delft. My research interests lie at the intersection of scientific machine learning and structural engineering.

I received my PhD from the same department at TU Delft, focusing on **physics-informed machine learning for beam structure applications**. Prior to that, I interned at [CAMLab](https://camlab.ethz.ch), the Seminar for Applied Mathematics at ETH Zurich, where I worked on physics-informed neural networks for fully non-linear PDEs.

I hold a master’s degree in **Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing** from [South Asian University](https://sau.int), India, and [Université de Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr), France.

You can find a recent copy of my [CV here](https://taniyakapoor.github.io/files/Taniya_CV_new.pdf).
