**News:** I’ll be joining the University of Oxford as a [Schmidt AI in Science Fellow!](https://saiis.web.ox.ac.uk/our-people?filter-13541-cohort-4319696=97706&page-4319696=0).

I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Engineering Structures Department](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures/sections-labs/railway-engineering/staff), Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at TU Delft. My research interests focus on the fusion of scientific machine learning and structural engineering. I believe AI has much potential to offer for science and engineering and will be embedded throughout the disciplines in the same way computers do today.

I received my PhD degree in physics-informed machine learning for beam structures applications, from the Engineering Structures Department at TU Delft. I was fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Hongrui Wang](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/h.wang.8/), [Dr. Alfredo Núñez](https://www.alfredonunez.net) and [Prof. Rolf Dollevoet](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/r.p.b.j.dollevoet/). Before this, I worked as an intern at [CAMLab](https://camlab.ethz.ch), seminar for applied mathematics at ETH Zurich, in physics-informed neural networks for fully non-linear PDEs. I received my master’s degree in applied mathematics and scientific computing from [South Asian University](https://sau.int), India, and [University de Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr), France.

Here is a recent copy of my  [CV](https://taniyakapoor.github.io/files/Taniya_CV_new.pdf).
