I am an Assistant Professor in the [**Artificial Intelligence Group**](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/plant-sciences/artificial-intelligence-group-1.htm) at Wageningen University & Research. My research interests lie broadly in Machine Learning for the Sciences and Science for Machine Learning. In particular, I focus on developing ML models that integrate physical knowledge such as partial differential equations, ordinary differential equations, and physical laws, to tackle global challenges.

I obtained my PhD at [**TU Delft**](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures), where I worked on physics-informed machine learning for structural engineering applications under the supervision of Dr. Hongrui Wang, Dr. Alfredo Núñez, and Prof. Rolf Dollevoet. Following the completion of my PhD, I was awarded the AI Schmidt Postdoctoral Fellowship at the [**University of Oxford**](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-05-02-oxford-welcomes-new-schmidt-ai-science-fellows), to develop engineering-informed foundation models for sustainable structural design. Prior to that, I worked at [**ETH Zürich (CAMLab)**](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html), on physics-informed neural networks for fully nonlinear PDEs.
