Currently, I am a PhD researcher in the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Engineering Structures Department at TU Delft. My research is centered around scientific machine learning with a main focus on developing efficient machine-learning approaches for solving Structural Engineering problems.

Prior to this, I worked as an intern in CAMLab, seminar for applied mathematics at ETH Zurich, on the project: physics-informed neural networks for fully non-linear PDEs. I received my masterâ€™s degree in applied mathematics and scientific computing from South Asian university, India and University de Lille, France.

Here is a recent copy of my  [CV](https://taniyakapoor.github.io/files/Taniya_CV.pdf).
