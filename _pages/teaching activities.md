Formulate a proposal for a master's course focusing on the integration of physics-informed machine learning within the context of beam dynamics. This includes providing three months of supervisory support to a group of 9 students dedicated to this project.

Prepared tutorial and exam based on machine learning for the following masters course: A1, MUDE, Dynamica

Supervision Activities: 

Led the proposal of master thesis on beam dynamics using PIML.
Co-Supervising one masters student on Beam dynamics using PIML.
Currently, Supervising two masters student on Extrapolation of PIML for three months.
