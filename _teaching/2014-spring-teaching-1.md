I am thrilled to share my active involvement and contributions to the cutting-edge intersection of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) and beam dynamics. My work focuses on pioneering educational initiatives, supervising student projects, and leading proposals that bridge these two vital fields of study. Here's an overview of my key contributions:

Master's Course Development and Supervision

I played a pivotal role in formulating a proposal for a master's course uniquely designed to integrate PIML within the context of beam dynamics. This initiative aimed at equipping students with the necessary skills to apply machine learning techniques in physics, particularly in understanding the dynamics of beams dynamics.

Supervisory Support: Central to this course was my commitment to providing three months of supervisory support to a group of nine dedicated students. This project was not just an educational journey but a pioneering exploration into applying PIML in practical, real-world scenarios within beam dynamics.

Educational Material Preparation

My efforts extended to the development of comprehensive tutorial and examination materials tailored for bachelor's and master's courses, including:

A1
MUDE
Dynamica

These resources were meticulously prepared to support the integration of machine learning into physics, ensuring students have access to both theoretical knowledge and practical applications.

Supervision Achievements

I have been deeply involved in supervising various projects at the forefront of PIML and beam dynamics. My supervision activities include:

Leading a Master Thesis Proposal: I spearheaded a master thesis proposal focusing on the application of PIML in beam dynamics, setting a new direction for future research in the field.
Co-Supervision of a Master's Thesis: I had the privilege of co-supervising a master's student whose thesis project centered on beam dynamics using PIML.
Direct Supervision of Student Projects: I am currently supervising two master's students on a project aimed at extrapolating Neural PDE solver.
